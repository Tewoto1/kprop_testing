"""analysis -- mechanistic-interpretability / circuit tools for the study MLP.

Everything lives in `analysis/Tools/` and is re-exported here, so
`from analysis import weight_spectrum` and `from analysis.Tools import ...`
both work. Each tool runs individually and returns a dict (no master report).
